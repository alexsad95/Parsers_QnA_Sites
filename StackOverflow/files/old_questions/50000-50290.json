S'\nSo I\'m interested in this theory that if you go to a random Wikipedia article, click the first link not inside parentheses repeatedly, in 95% of the cases you will end up on the article about Philosophy. \nI wanted to write a script in Python that does the link fetching for me and in the end, print a nice list of which articles were visited (linkA -> linkB -> linkC) etc.\nI managed to get the HTML DOM of the web pages, and managed to strip out some unnecessary links and the top description bar which leads disambiguation pages. So far I have concluded that:\n\nThe DOM begins with the table which you see on the right on some pages, for example in Human. We want to ignore these links.\nThe valid link elements all have a <p> element somewhere as their ancestor (most often parent or grandparent if it\'s inside a <b> tag or similar. The top bar which leads to disambiguation pages, does not seem to contain any <p> elements.\nInvalid links contain some special words followed by a colon, e.g. Wikipedia:\n\nSo far, so good. But it\'s the parentheses that get me. In the article about Human for example, the first link not inside parentheses is "/wiki/Species", but the script finds "/wiki/Taxonomy" which is inside them. \nI have no idea how to go about this programmatically, since I have to look for text in some combination of parent/child nodes which may not always be the same. Any ideas?\nMy code can be seen below, but it\'s something I made up really quickly and not very proud of. It\'s commented however, so you can see my line of thoughts (I hope :) ).\n\n'

S'\nAs far as my knowledge says in digest authentication, a client does an irreversible computation, using the password and a random value supplied by the server as input values. The result is transmitted to the server who does the same computation and authenticates the client if he arrives at the same value. Since the computation is irreversible, an eavesdropper can\'t obtain the password.\nKeeping eye on the above definition, I used CryptoJS.HmacSHA256("password", "key")  in Javascript  to send the information to django server, now the problem is:\nI need to check that in server using same logic but django already has hashed the password in its own format, for example using pbkdf2_sha256.\nShould I use some reversible algorithm like AES?

S"\nI'm writing a game server in Python and a game client in Game Maker with the Faucet Networking plugin (though that shouldn't matter). The client sends an UPDATEXY message to the server each time the player moves, and there is a message chatting thing in the client. With 2 clients connected to the server, it seems that the client gets overloaded with messages (further into the run time, chat messages appear slower and the player lags behind where the actual other player is). I believe this is because the client cannot process the messages at the rate they are flowing in, so I implemented a feature in the client where it would just dump all messages in the receive buffer, and ignore them. This seemed to work, but the player would jerk around violently. Is there any sort of 'clean fix' to this problem, or is it a fundamental thing that I have done wrong since the start? \nBy the way, the protocol I am using is TCP. Is this a problem with TCP itself or am I just using it wrong?

I'll try to explain where I'm at.\nI have a followed the SQLAlchemy tutorial to the point where I have two related tables and can manipulate/query those with no problems. Trying to establish a QTableView class apparently requires a setData() method with my own model, or using the default model requires a setItem() method.\nSo the question is how to design the model. I presume this means defining one of those two methods to query/modify the database. I don't know the right way to do this. \nThe model is supposed to be like User firstname and lastname repeated on a few rows until all the addresses have been shown, then move on to the next User. I can do this with nested for loops to print this at the prompt but I don't think making a big list is the way to go as that seems to defeat the point of having the database in the first place...\nI also don't know what will happen when the database grows, does the entire table become instantiated and held in memory or does Qt load rows and columns as they come in to view when the user scrolls?\nLot of text here sorry, but trying to be clear.

S"\nI'm trying to run a physics simulation (using ODE) in a wxPython application. My first attempt ran my simulation at 100Hz using a timer, however this actually ran at something closer to 60Hz. It's important that the rate of the simulation is accurate, so I wrote a small thread that slept for 0.01 seconds, and then sent a message (via wx.PostEvent) to the main UI thread that ran (and rendered) the simulation.\nThis completely hung the application, and from logging I can see that not all of the events that I'm sending (at 100Hz) are being processed. I presume therefore that I'm filling up the message queue and my UI grinds to a halt.\nWhen I set my thread to run at 50Hz, all works fine. But I mean, this is 2012 and I've got eight cores running at some absurd number of gigahertz or whatever. It doesn't seem to me that an accurate 100Hz is asking all that much.

S"\nI would to ask if using the Delegate Pattern in Python would lead to circular references and if so, what would be the best way to implement it to ensure the object and its delegate will be garbage collected?\nIn Objective C, the above problem is avoided by using a weak reference to the delegate. In C++, we don't call delete on the delegate. I've found a link to Python's weak reference module here: http://docs.python.org/library/weakref.html. It seems like a plausible approach might be to create a weak reference to refer to the instance variable using this module but I'm not sure.\nAs I've googled this question and was not able to find answers to it, I'm wondering whether this is even a problem in Python or if there is a common solution (without the need for the weakref module) that I'm unaware of? Also, I did search stackoverflow before asking but the questions I found either deal with circular imports or delegate pattern in general and not specific to Python and the problem of circular references.\nThanks in advance for any replies.\nListed below is some code for a toy example to help illustrate my question. I've implemented code in this way and it works but I'm not sure whether memory is garbage collected at the end.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter reading some of the replies, I decided to clarify my question. I understand that Python has garbage collection. What I wasn't sure was whether it will perform garbage collection on circular referenced objects. My worries stems from the following passage from Python's doc:\n\nThe passage in its original form can be found here: http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html The bold setting is mine.\nThe following post provides a clearer explanation on the problem of circular referenced objects and why it would prevent garbage collection on those objects (at least in a typical setting): http://www.electricmonk.nl/log/2008/07/07/python-destructor-and-garbage-collection-notes/.\nFurther, I just came across Alex Martellli's reply to the following question on whether Python users should worry about circular reference: Should I worry about circular references in Python? From his answer, I gather that even though circular referenced objects will eventually be garbage collected BUT there would be overheads. Whether it is significant depends on the program. \nFurther, he mentioned to use Python's weakref module but did not explicitly say how. \nHence, I would like to add the following questions to clarify some unresolved issues:\n\nThe docs say garbaged collection is not guaranteed for circular\nreferenced objects. But from the replies it appears that is not the\ncase. So have I misunderstood the passage or are there further\ndetails that I've missed?\nI suppose using a weak reference, as stated in Alex's reply and my\nquestion, would avoid the overhead the problem entirely?\n\nAgain thanks for the replies.\n"

S"\nI'm using wxPython and wxPropertyGrid to create a UI and am having trouble getting a LongStringProperty to behave as I want it to.

The problem is that firstly PG_PROP_NO_ESCAPE doesn't seem to be defined in wxPython, and secondly it requires subclassing.  If my understanding is correct you can't directly subclass in wxPython but rather has to be done using propertygrid.PyProperty which would basically mean creating the whole class again from scratch!  Now I'm not sure if I believe that last statement or if I've just made it up, but either way if PG_PROP_NO_ESCAPE isn't defined I can't set it so it's a moot point. \nSo my question is:  Is it possible to hide escape sequences in LongStringProperties in wxPython without creating the whole class again from scratch, and if so how do you do it?\n"

S'\nSuppose you have a sqlite database with several thousand rows -- each of which either contains or references a sizable, unique blob -- and you want to sparsely sample this collection, pulling rows based on rowid or some equivalent primary key. I find that the first time I attempt to fetch several (500) datapoints after connecting (out of 20k rows), the call takes over 10 seconds to return; and, with every successive iteration, the calls get shorter and shorter, until converging to around 100 milliseconds after 50-100 such queries.\nClearly, either sqlite or its python wrapper must be caching... something. If I clear out inactive memory (I\'m in OS X, but I think Linux has a comparable if-not-identical "purge" command?), the behavior can be replicated exactly. The question is, what is it caching that an index doesn\'t address? And furthermore, is it possible to automatically pull whatever information is accelerating these queries into memory from the start? Or is there something else I\'ve missed entirely?\nA few notes in case someone doesn\'t immediately know the answer... \n\nEach blob is around 40kB, and are a large (ha) source of the problem. I\'ve some code below for anyone who wants to play along at home, but I\'ve had better luck keeping separate tables for sortable information and data. This introduces an inner join, but it\'s generally been better than keeping it all together (although if anyone feels this is wrong, I\'m keen to hear it). Without the inner join / data fetch, things start at 4 seconds and drop to 3 ms in a hurry.\nI feel like this might be a PRAGMA thing, but I fiddled with some settings suggested by others in the wilderness of the web and didn\'t really see any benefit.\nIn-memory databases are not an option. For one, I\'m trying to share across threads (which might not actually be a problem for in-mems...? not sure), but more importantly the database files are typically on the order of 17 GB. So, that\'s out.\nThat being said, there\'s no problem caching a reasonable amount of information. After a few dozen calls, inactive memory gets somewhat bloated anyways, but I\'d rather do it (1) right and (2) efficiently.\n\nOkay, now some code for anyone who wants to try to replicate things. You should be able to copy and paste it into a stand-alone script (that\'s basically what I did, save for formatting).\n\nNow, if you want to replicate things, do the following. On my machine, this creates an 800MB database and produces something like below.\n\nSo... what say you, knowledgable sages?\n'

S'\nI have been experimenting with the Bus breakdown example in the Simpy\nmanual and am really struggling to understand why when I create\nmultiple instances of Bus, the last instance seems to get "of\nsequence" after the first repair.

I would have expected that both Buses would\nbreak down and get repaired in "lock step."\nFurther, if I create four Buses, the first three fail and get repaired\nin "lock step" as shown below; however, Bus 4 gets off sequence by 20\nafter the first repair.

S'\nI am having a little trouble with a server / client design and\nwonder if anyone had any advice.\nI have a Thrift server that abstracts a data store.  The idea is that\nthere will be a number of clients that are essentially\nout of process plugins that use the interface provided by the server\nto receive, manipulate the underlying data store and also provide\ntheir own data.\nThere will be a number of other clients which simply access the data\nprovided by the server and its "plugins".\nThe  problem case is when one of these "plugins" wishes to provide its\nown data and provide an interface to that data.\nThe server should have no knowledge of the plugins data or interface.\nI would ideally like all clients to access functionality through the\nmain thrift server so it acts as a facade for the plugins. If a client\nrequested some data provided by a plugin the main server could\ndelegate to the plugin to provide that data. I guess this would mean\nhave each plugin being a thrift client and server. I have written the\nserver in python so could probably handle thrift calls that are not\nyet defined but would it be possible to forward these calls another\nthrift server IE act as a proxy ?\nAn alternative is maybe have the plugins be clients only and push data\nto the server. But the format of these messages\nwould unknown to the server and would have to be generic enough to\naccommodate different types of data. I not sure how I would provide a\nuseful interface to this data to other clients.\nAs far as I can see only the plugins knows how to store and manipulate\nthe data it owns so this idea probably would not work.\nThanks for any advice.

The second argument is a list of keywords that were passed, the positions at which they were passed and, very likely, some sort of indicator flag telling at which position the keywords begin and position becomes irrelevant. \nPyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords then uses its list of keywords (4th argument) to map between arguments specified with a keyword and both the format string (3rd argument) and addresses of C variables (5th & + arguments) to which the appropriate values should be copied.\nIs my understanding correct?

When I try to run manage.py (with or without a command), I get the following error:\n\nI understand that manage.py is supposed to set that environment variable. I also understand that I might be getting this error because the project is not in the python path... but adding it manually seems like it shouldn't be necessary. Isn't manage.py supposed to resolve this issue as well?\nEdit: I've just tested and found that it does the exact same thing under Linux.\nEdit: Here's a useful discovery: I only get this error if I install Django via PIP, it works fine if I install the python-django package on Ubuntu. So there's something that the debian package is doing that PIP isn't. Maybe the debian package sets some environment variables? I need to figure that out, since I'm trying to develop on Windows.\nEdit: I think I've found the problem, but not a solution. Working on an Ubuntu machine, when I install Django via PIP (pip install django), this project doesn't work with the error I gave. If I create a new project (django-admin startproject testproject) and try that it works, and it consists of manage.py in the created folder, with another folder that contains everything else. Like this:\n\nWhen I install the Debian package (apt-get install python-django) the project I'm trying to work on works, and if I create a test project (django-admin startproject testproject) it has a folder structure like this:\n\nNotice the difference: the PIP Django package seems to put the manage.py outside of the python module that is the app, while the Debian package puts manage.py inside the module. I assume that this is due to the two packages being of a different version of Django, in between which they changed the structure, because the two packages doing this differently doesn't make any sense.\nSo my problem is that the project I'm trying to develop was originally generated using the version that's been Debian packaged, while on my Windows machine I'm trying to use the version of Django from pip.\nThe trouble is that I'm not certain how to fix the problem. Naively moving the manage.py up a directory so it's above the project folder doesn't work, because this 'debian-package version' manage.py tries to just import settings, which fails if it's not in the same folder as settings.py. But somewhere else in Django, something seems to be expecting the project itself to be at //settings.py (as would be the case if the pip version of django-admin was used) rather than at /settings.py (as is the case if the debian-package version is used).\nIf I look it up, the version in the Ubuntu repositories is 1.3.1, while the version in PyPI is 1.4. Look at the release notes for 1.4, and hey:\n\nBut... shouldn't projects generated with the 1.3 layout still work under 1.4..?\n"

S'\nHy there!\nI am actually working on some geodata datasets. I am using python and pygrib to read the original data. pygrib returns wonderfull longitude/latitude values for my "rotated" grid (see plot). What i have to do is to bring the data onto an orthogonal geo-longitude/latitude (so a meshgrid). \nIt is no problem to do it by hand BUT i think that python has a package which does it for me? If yes i hanvt found any good hint in the web.\npygrib seems to know enough about the projection to compute my latlons. So i guess that there is a package somewhere which transforms (with interpolation) my data into another projection? :)\nProbably there is someone out there which can give me some hints and/or links. Would be great! \nThanks and best wishes\nReto Stauffer, Austria\n\n'

Everything was going swimmingly until the application started to crash. After a few days of making no progress I finally noticed that my application was leaking memory. I was able to distill into a smallish example script something that leaks at a quite extraordinary rate:\n\nThe example creates a frame, and places a wxPropertyGrid into it. It derives a property that display a 3d co-ordinate value, creates a thousand of them, and then from a timer running at 100Hz it updates each to a random value. This leaks somewhere close to 10Mb/sec, and eventually crashes. It usually crashes at shutdown too.\nI'm using python 2.7 & wx 2.9.3.1 msw (classic) on Windows 7.\nIf I replace my derived CoordProperty with a built-in property, such as wxpg.FloatProperty, and modify the code accordingly, the leak goes away.\nAny ideas?

S'\nI\'m having a problem getting this program to work and it\'s about 2:00am here so I really just want to get it over with. Anyways, I\'m required to create a program in which the total sum and average of donations over several weeks (input by the user) is calculated and displayed. This program uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average. \nThe way it works is: \n\nThe program asks for the number of weeks\nAn outer loop iterates once every week\nAn inner loop iterates 5 times per week\nEach iteration of the inner loop asks the user for an amount of donation\nAfter all iterations, the sum of the donations and the average of the donations over each week is displayed\n\nThere are three main problems that I have in creating this program. The first is that my nesting of loops is not working the way I want it to. \n\nFor example if the user inputs 3 weeks, I expect the program to get the amount 5 times per week, so 15 times. But it doesn\'t, and instead only asks for an amount twice. \nSecond problem is when the user inputs 1 week or 0 weeks, an error occurs which states \n"NameError: name \'amount\' is not defined"\nThe final problem is something I actually haven\'t touched on yet in the coding, which is how I will calculate the week\'s total (week_total) if the user inputs different amounts each day. I only state amount as one variable when really, there are 5 amount variables for 5 days of the week. \nAgain, I\'m very new to python and my instruction guide really don\'t touch upon specifics like these. I\'ve been trying rearranging and changing this program for two hours or so now, and I\'m still pretty stuck. Hoping someone here can share their knowledge. Much thanks. \n'

S'\nFirstly my maths is limited, so this question may have a simple answer. So, I am using the following equation to make guassian distributions:\n\nWhen I make gussians with the above equation where is the width of the peak applied? Is it at full width half maximum? I made the following gaussian with the following values:\n\n\nWhen I then calculate the FWHM it is 16.6510941453 so the peak width cannot be applied at the FWHM. Where is it applied?\nI am trying to constrain the FWHM so the FWHM is 10x smaller than that of the mean. So in the above example I would of liked the gaussian to have a FWHM of 10 at the mean of 100 at a peak height of 5.\n'

S'\nEDIT: If I explicity change the backend for matplotlib from \'Qt4Agg\' to just \'Agg\' then I am able to run my code with no errors. I assume this is a bug in the backend? \nI am writing some code for processing a fairly large amount of data automatically. The code first of all parses my data files and stores all of the relevant bits. I then have different functions for producing each of the graphs I need (there are about 25 in all). However, I keep running into some kind of memory error and I think it is because Matplotlib / PyPlot are not releasing the memory correctly. \nEach plotting function ends with a pyplot.close(fig) command and since I just want to save the graphs and not look at them immediately they do not include a pyplot.show(). \nIf I run the plotting functions individually in an interpreter then I don\'t get any problems. However, if I make a separate function which calls each plotting function in turn then I run into a "MemoryError: Could not allocate memory for path". \nHas anyone came across a problem like this? It would seem to be related to Matplotlib runs out of memory when plotting in a loop but pyplot.close() doesn\'t fix my problem. \nThis is what a typical plot function looks like in my code:\n\nIf I now run in a terminal\n\nThen I don\'t get any errors. The same is true for all of my plot functions. \nIf I make a new function which does this:\n\nThen it runs through about half of the graphs and then I get "MemoryError: Could not allocate memory for path".\n'

S'\nI am working on writing a quick REST service to manage email accounts for our domain and have ran into a strange behavior I can\'t explain.\nI am using mysql to authenticate email accounts, and our REST service manages the maildirs and inserts or updates auth credentials using a web interface.  The queries for inserting users as well as updating their passwords both use the encrypt mysql command.\nWhat is strange is that inserted users won\'t work for authentication until the password is changed on the REST interface at least once.  This means that encrypt is setting the right value for an update, but something wrong for an insert.  \nI have tried logging everything in the GET/POST params on the rest service side and it seems like something is going wrong in the database tier.  The REST service logs correct params for passwords at both endpts.  Something in the execution of the queries is different.\nMy queries look like such (using MySQLdb in Python):\nADD_USER = "INSERT INTO users (id,name,maildir,crypt) VALUES (%s,%s,%s,encrypt(%s));"\nCHANGE_PASS = "UPDATE users SET crypt = encrypt(%s) WHERE id=%s"\nAgain, ADD_USER is entering a bad hash where CHANGE_PASS succeeds with the exact same HTTP parameters for crypt passed into them (as strings).  Is there any reason why the data tier would do different encryption, or am I barking up the wrong tree?\n'

S'\nI am trying to make an application that displays a PDF file, using PyQt4 and python-poppler-qt4.\nSo far I have managed to display the entire document by loading pixmaps generated with Poppler, set on a QLabel and appended to a QFrame. The QFrame is displayed in a QScrollArea.\nIt looks pretty good, until implementing zooming, which is done by regenerating the pixmaps all over again, with an incremented resolution. This process requires the entire document to be rendered into pixmaps, which obviously takes time and results into an unwanted lag.\nLogic wants that I should display images of the pages I am seeing only (it sounds like quantum physics). I have two options in mind:\n\ncreate blank pages with QLabels and load the image onto them when they become visible in the scroll area;\ncreate only one page and add or remove precedent or subsequent pages right before it should be displayed.\n\nI am not sure I am on the right track or whether there is an alternative. \nThe first option seems more feasible, because the visibility of a blank page determines when the pixmap has to be uploaded (although I have no idea how to delete that pixmap when the page is hidden). Yet I am not sure that zooming will be faster this way, since a document of, say, 600 pages, will have to be regenerated, albeit with blank pages.\nThe second option should definitely improve zooming since 1 to 4 pages at a time would have to be regenerated when zooming. In that second case however, I am not sure how to trigger the construction of pages.\nWhat would you suggest? \n'
