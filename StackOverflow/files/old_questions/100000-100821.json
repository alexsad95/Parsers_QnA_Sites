S'\nI work in a Java/PHP shop (mainly), and a few Python projects are being pushed in this shop, using Python (CPython 2.7.2) with Django (1.4.3). \nFor the Continuous Integration, we use Maven (along with other tools). \nI am looking for successful examples of integrations of Django projects with Maven. By successful, I mean those that give more powers (for releasing, packaging, build process) than burdens (long process, no immediate results of Python methods, like no compiling compared to Java). I am also looking for any documentation on the subject.\nSo far, I only find this serie of blog posts on how to integrate Python with Maven, which explains on how to integrate a python package development process on Maven. I am looking for similar example on a more specific example, ie, Django.\nNB: I am very aware of more adapted build and management tools for Python (Fabric, Paver, etc) but I am bound on the use of the same framework used throughout the shop.\n'

S'\nI\'m writing a small web app that I\'d like to include the ability to download itself. The ideal solution would be for users to be able to "pip install" the full app but that users of the app would be able to download a version of it to use themselves (perhaps with reduced functionality or without some of the less essential dependencies).\nI\'m currently using Bottle as I\'d like to keep everything as close to the standard library as possible. Users could be on different platforms or Python versions, which are other reasons for minimising the use of extra modules. (Though I\'ll assume 2.7 or 3.3 will be in use regardless of platform).\nMy current thinking is to have the app use __file__ or similar and zip itself up. It could also use setuptools/distribute and call sdist on itself. Users could then execute the zip file, or install the app using the source distribution. (ideally I\'d like to provide both of these options).\nThe app would include aggressive import checking to fallback to available modules, with Bottle being the only requirement (and would be included in the downloaded file).\nCan anyone think of a robust approach to providing this functionality?\nUpdate: users of the app cannot be guaranteed to have internet access at all times, hence the requirement for being able to download a version of the app from someone who as previously installed it. Python experience cannot be assumed either, hence the idea of letting users run python -m myApp.zip to run their own version.\nUpdate II: as the level of python experience also cannot be guaranteed I\'d want the simplest way for a user to get a mostly working version of the app. Experienced users would then be free to \'upgrade\' the app by installing their own choice of additional modules. The vast majority of these would be different servers to host the app from (CherryPy, Twisted, etc) and so would not strictly count as a dependency but a "nice to have".\nUpdate III: based on the answer below I will look into a PyPI/buildout based solution but would still be interested in whether there is a specific solution to the above approach.\n'

S"\nI'm running a Flask app on Heroku using gunicorn with eventlet workers. A particular route on my app frequently receives POST data (x-www-form-urlencoded) with some fairly chunky fields -- on the order of 500KB at most.\nThis works fine when running locally, but on Heroku, requests to that route takes anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds to complete -- and almost 100% of the time is spent in the first access to request.form:\n\nThis is confirmed by Newrelic slow request tracing as well. There's a few milliseconds here or there for the database operations, and then a huge chunk of time in Python code, apparently spent waiting on some i/o, since the reported CPU time is usually less than a millisecond.\nI have been totally unable to reproduce this in a local environment using the same gunicorn/eventlet setup I'm using in production. Even the built-in debug WSGI server is lightning-fast on these requests.\nDoes anybody have any idea what might be going wrong?

S'\nAnyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:\n\nPython novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: [5]. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):\n\nA manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it "a dramatic design flaw" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don\'t understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)\nEdit: \nBaczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal\'s in particular, I elaborated further:\n\nTo me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function or "together" with it?\nDoing the binding inside the function would mean that x is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the def line would be "hybrid" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.\nThe actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.\n'

This just lets me treat the dict with object notation, so I can use the same templates and helpers for these read-only dicts as I do with the active SqlAlchemy objects.  ( I also like storing cached data as dicts , so I can use the same cached values for other apps or languages )\nEverything is working perfectly.\nI've been exploring ways to make caching a bit better, and rembered Pyramid's @reify decorator ( http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/decorator.html ).  @reify lets an object method overwrite itself with the return value of the funciton, this way the underlying function is only called once.  This idea is very attractive to me for caching purposes.\n[ As mentioned in comments, memoization is a more proper term ]\nProblem:\nI'm at a loss though on how to best approach something like this.  Trying to dynamically set the object properties to redefine themselves is way harder than I thought it would be.  @reify is so simple and works so well because it's on a predefined class.  \nThe best of what I've come up with so far is this...\n\nThis has a few obvious and huge caveats though.  It only works on string context ( because I'm overloading repr ) and I can only return string values.  \nAnyone have clues on how I should proceed ?\nUpdate:\nI've come up with this working example of what i want to do.  does anyone see any issues with this approach :\n\n"

S'\nQuestion\nCan a property access trigger a session flush in SQLAlchemy? My expectation would be for, e.g., queries attached to an object via column_property() or @hybrid_property to cause a session autoflush, in the same way that queries made through session.Query() do. That does not seem to be the case.\nIn the simple example below, an Account contains an Entry collection. It also provides a "balance" property, constructed with column_property(), that exposes a select-sum query. New entries only appear in an account\'s balance if session.flush() is called explicitly.\nThis behavior seems suboptimal: users of the Account class need to sprinkle flush() calls throughout their code based on knowing the internals of the balance implementation. If the implementation changes---e.g., if "balance" was previously a Python @property---bugs can be introduced even though the Account interface is essentially identical. Is there an alternative?\nComplete Example\n\nObserved Output\n\nPreferred Output\nI\'d like to see "account.balance: 42", without adding an explicit call to session.flush().\n'

S'\nI need to crossmatch a list of astronomical coordinates with different catalogues, and I want to decide a maximum radius for the crossmatch.

My initial list is supossed to be the position of a known object, but it could happend that it is not detected in the catalog, and my coordinates may suffer from small offsets.\nThey way I am computing the maximum radius is by fitting the gaussian kernel density of the separation with a gaussian, and use the center + 3sigmas value. The method works nicely for most of the cases, but when a small subsample of my list has an offset, I have two gaussians instead. In these cases, I will specify the max radius in a different way.\nMy problem is that when this happens, curve_fit can\'t normally do the fit with one gaussian. For a scientific publication, I will need to justify the "no fit" in curve_fit, and in which cases the "different way" is used. Could someone give me a hand on what this means in mathematical terms?\n'

I'm able to create both widgets and delete either one of them on the Button's callback, but to pack_forget both I believe I need to def a function.

Now I need to find how many of these list elements have a C or A or T or G as its 1st letter. This needs to be taken from the terminal i.e. using the input function.\nNow as far i know, in python 3.2 the datatype of input function is by default taken as a string (str) and not like an integer (int) (can be seen by using isinstance). However since I am using a college server, the python version is older (i think 2.7 or later but below 3.0). In this case, when I use the input function to ask the user to choose a letter-     initial = input("Choose a letter:"), and when I enter any letter (A,T,G,or C) it gives me an error NameError: name \'C\' is not defined. When i checked the datatype using isinstance, i realized that the python version takes the datatype of input as an int . When i try to convert it into a string, it gives the same error.

S'\nSpecification of the problem:\nI am running some complex tasks in python and to speed it up, I decided to use pythons multiprocessing library. It worked pretty well, but after some time I started to wonder, how much time are the Locks, I use, consuming and how much are the processes blocking each other.\nThe structure of processes is following:\nOne process that updates shared list between processes. Code of data update is something like this:\n\nwhere list_rex and lock are defined by \n\nAnd then there are several processes, that once in a while updates their own memory space with these list.The code is as follows:\n\nsome_list and some_dict are somehow related so I can not allow processes to have information in some_list from different update than is in some_dict.\nAnd my question is, how fast are the methods acquire() and release()? In my case they can be called within seconds and sometimes milliseconds. And/Or is there some way how to avoid using locks in my case?\nThank you for your time.\nEDIT: after considering your comment my question probably should be - how are proxy lists affecting my calculations? I use "some_list" and "some_dict" really a lot to be read from after the update.\n'

S'\nI am building a very basic platform in the form of a Python 2.7 module. This module has a read-eval-print loop where entered user commands are mapped to function calls. Since I am trying to make it easy to build plugin modules for my platform, the function calls will be from my Main module to an arbitrary plugin module. I\'d like a plugin builder to be able to specify the command that he wants to trigger his function, so I\'ve been looking for a Pythonic way to remotely enter a mapping in the command->function dict in the Main module from the plugin module.\nI\'ve looked at several things:\n\nMethod name parsing: the Main module would import the plugin module\nand scan it for method names that match a certain format. For\nexample, it might add the download_file_command(file) method to its\ndict as "download file" -> download_file_command. However, getting a\nconcise, easy-to-type command name (say, "dl") requires that the\nfunction\'s name also be short, which isn\'t good for code\nreadability. It also requires the plugin developer to conform to a\nprecise naming format. \nCross-module decorators: decorators would let\nthe plugin developer name his function whatever he wants and simply\nadd something like @Main.register("dl"), but they would necessarily\nrequire that I both modify another module\'s namespace and keep\nglobal state in the Main module. I understand this is very bad.\nSame-module decorators: using the same logic as above, I could add a\ndecorator that adds the function\'s name to some command name->function mapping local to the\nplugin module and retrieve the mapping to the Main module with an\nAPI call. This requires that certain methods always be present or\ninherited though, and - if my understanding of decorators is correct - the function will only register itself the first time it is run and will unnecessarily re-register itself every subsequent time\nthereafter.\n\nThus, what I really need is a Pythonic way to annotate a function with the command name that should trigger it, and that way can\'t be the function\'s name. I need to be able to extract the command name->function mapping when I import the module, and any less work on the plugin developer\'s side is a big plus.\nThanks for the help, and my apologies if there are any flaws in my Python understanding; I\'m relatively new to the language.\n'

S"\nI have 2 csv files. The first, input, consists of input street addresses with various errors. The second, ref is a clean street address table. Records within input need to be matched to records within ref. Converting the files to lists with unique records is fast, but once I get to the matching process, it's dreadfully slow, taking a full 85 seconds just to match two addresses within input to ref without any regular expressions! I realize that the size of ref is the issue here; it is over 1 million records in length and the file size is 30 MB. I was anticipating some performance issues with these kinds of sizes, but taking this long for only two records is unacceptable (realistically, I may have to match up to 10,000 records or more. Additionally, I will eventually need to embed some regex to ref items to allow for more flexible matching.

S'\nWell, approximating a circle with a polygon and Pythagoras\' story may be well known. \nBut what about the other way around? \nI have some polygons, that should be in fact circles. However, due to measurement errors they are not. So, what I\'m looking for is the circle that best "approximates" the given polygon. \nIn the following figure we can see two different examples. \n\nMy first Ansatz was to find the maximum distance of the points to the center as well as the minimum. The circle we are looking for is maybe somewhere in between. \nIs there any algorithm out there for this problem?\n'

S'\nI want to write fastAGI scripts in Python. I have looked up all over the net to find very minimal documentation on this. Until now I have found that there is pyst, pyst2, starpy which are quite popular. But the problem is, they lack even the bare essential documentation (or atleast I did not find any). I want to know if there are any good resources to get started with fastAGI programming in python using any of the libraries that exist instead of me rewriting everything from scratch.\nI also want to know if there are any other good libraries like the ones I have mentioned.\nIf nothing is available, what are my options?\n'

S'\nI am currently writing a program in Python 3.3.0 which prints out the n first square numbers and finally prints out their sum. The condition is that the user can only compute an integral number of terms greater than zero. Here is the code:\n\nNow, I managed to code the error message for when the user types in a negative number. However, I am having difficulties coding an error message for when the user types in a string, such as "fifteen". \nI want the program to allow the user to try assigning \'n\' a value once again and again, just as if they had typed a negative number; basically I want to code a loop asking for the same thing over and over again if the user inputs a string.\nThe problem is that input() always assigns a string to an arbitrary variable, so I tried writing code for converting the string to an integer. It works fine when the user inputs an integral value, however it cannot define int(n) if \'n\' is not an integer.\nI have googled a lot regarding this issue and I found some examples using try and except ValueError but none of them seem to be able to create a loop out of it.\nAnybody got an idea?\n'

S'\nI am trying to write a program in python that parses out lines of data that match certain criteria from an input file to a series of output files. \nThis program reads an input file containing the start and stop positions of genes on a chromosome. For each line of this input file, it opens a second input file line-by-line that contains the locations of known SNPs on the chromosome of interest. If the SNP is located between the start and stop position of the gene being iterated, it is copied to a new file. \nThe problem with my program as it stands is that it is inefficient. For each gene being analyzed, the program starts reading the input file of SNP data from the very first line and does not stop until it reaches a SNP that is located on a chromosomal position that is greater (i.e. has a higher position number) than the stop position of the gene being iterated. As all the gene and SNP data is ordered by chromosomal location, the speed and efficiency of my program would be greatly improved if, for each gene being iterated, I could somehow \xe2\x80\x98tell\xe2\x80\x99 my program to start reading the input file of SNP location data from the last line that was read in the last iteration; rather than from the first line of the file. \nIs there any way to do this Python?

S'\nI have been working on a problem for a while (I am a chemical engineer, so it takes me forever to understand how to code something) of how to have several tabs operating in their own process, but with each tab having it\'s own data to show in a matplotlib plot.\nI have been running into many pickling errors and I wondered if anyone had any somewhat simple solutions.  I believe the main reasons for the pickling errors is due to the object I am trying to pass as a property into the tab object.  This object holds some data as well as many other objects which help fit the data it holds. \nI feel like these objects are very nice and rather necessary, but I also realize that they are causing the problems with pickling.\nHere is a very simplified version of my code:\n(This will still compile if you want to copy/paste to test it out.)\n\nI have noticed that the errors are coming from matplotlib axes (I\'m not sure how?) and gives the error pickle.PicklingError: Can\'t pickle <class \'matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot\'>: it\'s not found as matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot. In addition, I have noticed that commenting out the matplotlib plots will also give the pickling error pickle.PicklingError: Can\'t pickle <function <lambda> at 0x012A2B30>: it\'s not found as lmfit.parameter.<lambda>.  I think this is because lambda functions cannot be pickled and I guess lmfit has a lambda somewhere in it\'s depths... but I don\'t really know what to do without some way around these errors.\nOddly enough, the error I see form the original code (not the simplified version shown here) is slightly different, but still basically the same in sentiment.  The error I get in my other code is pickle.PicklingError: Can\'t pickle \'BufferRegion\' object: <BufferRegion object at 0x037EBA04>\nDoes anyone have a better solution to this problem by moving the objects around in regards to where I pass them or any other ideas?\nI very much appreciate your time and effort and any help on this problem.\nEDIT: I tried unutbu\'s idea in a way, but with some alterations to the position of the process funciton.\nThe only problem with the proposed solution is that the do_long_fitting_process() function calls another function which iteratively updates the lines in the matplotlib plots. So the do_long_fitting_process() needs to have some access to the Special_Tab properties to change them and show the updates to the GUI.\nI have tried doing this by pushing the do_long_fitting_process() function to just a global function and calling this:\n[code]\ndef open_tabs(self):\n        for i in range(0, 10):\n            ...\n            self.tabs_list.append(new_tab)\n\n[/code]\nWhere I am passing the data to update_GUI() via a mp.Pipe(), but the window just goes to "Not Responding" as soon as I start the processes.\n'

S'\nAwhile ago I wrote a Markov chain text generator for IRC in Python. It would consume all of my VPS\'s free memory after running for a month or two and I would need to purge its data and start over. Now I\'m rewriting it and I want to tackle the memory issue as elegantly as possible.\nThe data I have to keep trimmed down is a generally a dictionary that maps strings to lists of strings. More specifically, each word in a message is mapped to all the possible subsequent words. This is still an oversimplification, but it\'s sufficient for contextualizing my problem.\nCurrently, the solution I\'m wrestling with involves managing "buckets" of data. It would keep track of each bucket\'s apparent size, "archive" a bucket once it\'s reached a certain size and move on to a new one, and after 5 or so buckets it would delete the oldest "archived" bucket every time a new one is created. This has the advantage of simplicity: removing an entire bucket doesn\'t create any dead-ends or unreachable words because the words from each message all go into the same bucket.\nThe problem is that "keeping track of each bucket\'s apparent size" is easier said than done.\nI first tried using sys.getsizeof, but quickly found that it\'s impractical for determining the object\'s actual size in memory. I\'ve also looked into guppy / heapy / various other memory usage modules, but none of them seem to do what I\'m looking for (i.e. benchmark a single object). Currently I\'m experimenting with the lower-level psutil module. Here\'s an excerpt from the current state of the application:\n\nThe problem here is that this will only expire buckets; I have no idea when to "archive" the current bucket because Python\'s overhead memory prevents me from accurately determining how far I am from hitting self.MAX_MEMORY. Not to mention that the Markov class is actually one of many "plugins" being managed by a headless IRC client (another detail I omitted for brevity\'s sake), so the overhead is not only present, but unpredictable.\nIn short: is there a way to accurately benchmark single Python objects? Alternatively, if you can think of a better way to \'expire\' old data than my bucket-based solution, I\'m all ears.\n'

S"\nI wrote a virtual machine language to assembly translator for a computer systems course I'm taking (using the nand2tetris curriculum). I originally wrote it in Python, but since I'm learning D, I thought I'd translate it. D is fairly close to Python syntactically, so it wasn't too difficult. I assumed that D, being a performance language and compiled, would be at least as fast as Python and on a large file, would be much faster. But the opposite is true! Despite identical algorithms, D consistently performed slightly slower than python when I constructed a very large file to compile. On a file approximately 500000 lines long, python consistently took about 2.6 seconds to complete, while D consistently took about 3. This isn't an enormous gap, but it's notable that python would be at all faster.\nI don't want to suggest that I'm naive enough to think that python is actually faster than D overall; however, in this instance it seems at the very least that D is not intuitively faster. I'd appreciate some input on possible sources of performance decreases in my D code. I think the bottleneck might be on IO operations, but I'm not sure.\nThe source code is below. The details aren't that important; some assembly language templates are allocated and then there's a linear pass through the virtual machine language, translating each instruction to an equivalent block of assembly code.\nEDIT: after recompiling the D code using dmd -O -release -inline -m64, D comes out the victor with a time of 2.20s on the input. However, the question still remains of why with almost identical code, D seems to perform slower than python.\nEDIT 2: using the advice from below, I switched from using a simple list of strings, to using an appender!string(), and improved the time by a noticeable amount. It's worth mentioning however, that if you have a bunch of strings in an appender, do not write them to a file with a command like:\n\nRather instead, write something like:\n\nThe second example will give you a small performance increase over using a simple string[]. But using the first one gave me a huge performance hit, doubling the execution time.\nChanging to an appender!string(), the compilation of the aforementioned large file took about 2.75 seconds (to Python's 2.8), where the original had taken about 3. Doing this, and also using the optimization flags in dmd, gave a total compilation time of 1.98 seconds! :)\nPython:\n\nD:\n\n"

S'\nI am using the Pyramid web framework with SQLAlchemy, connected to a MySQL backend.  The app I\'ve put together works, but I\'m trying to add some polish by way of some enhanced logging and exception handling.  \nI based everything off of the basic SQLAlchemy tutorial on the Pyramid site, using the session like so:\n\nUsing DBSession to query works great, and if I need to add and commit something to the database I\'ll do something like \n\nSo I get my new ID.\nThen I wanted to add logging to the database, so I followed this tutorial. That seemed to work great.  I did initially run into some weirdness with things getting committed and I wasn\'t sure how SQLAlchemy was working so I had changed "transaction.commit()" to "DBSession.flush()" to force the logs to commit (this is addressed below!).\nNext I wanted to add custom exception handling with the intent that I could put a friendly error page for anything that wasn\'t explicitly caught and still log things.  So based on this documentation I created error handlers like so:\n\nSo now my problem is, exceptions are caught and my custom exception view comes up as expected.  But the exceptions aren\'t logged to the database.  It appears this is because the DBSession transaction is rolled back on any exception.  So I changed the logging handler back to "transaction.commit".  This had the effect of actually committing my exception logs to the database, BUT now any DBSession action after any log statement throws an "Instance not bound to a session" error...which makes sense because from what I understand after a transaction.commit() the session is cleared out.  The console log always shows exactly what I want logged, including the SQL statements to write the log info to the database.  But it\'s not committing on exception unless I use transaction.commit(), but if I do that then I kill any DBSession statements after the transaction.commit()!.\nSooooo....how might I set things up so that I can log to the database, but also catch and successfully log exceptions to the database, too?  I feel like I want the logging handler to use some sort of separate database session/connection/instance/something so that it is self-contained but I\'m unclear on how that might work.  \nOr should I architect what I want to do completely different?\nEDIT:\nI did end up going with a separate, log-specific session dedicated only to adding committing log info to the database. This seemed to work well until I started integrating a Pyramid console script into the mix, in which I ran into problems with sessions and database commits within the script not necessarily working like they do in the actual Pyramid web application.\nIn hindsight (and what I\'m doing now) instead of logging to a database I use the standard logging and FileHandlers (TimedRotatingFileHandlers specifically) and log to the file system. \n'

S'\nI just wanted to integrate the opencv video stream from my web cam into a more complex gui than highgui can offer, nothing fancy just a couple of buttons and something else, however it\'s proven to be not that trivial. I can\'t find any base example from which I can start designing the gui.\nI tried converting this code to the new opencv interface with quite a poor result. I\'m a new to opencv, numpy and gui design. Some time does stream the video but most of the time it just hangs there. I guess my one mistake might be in wx.BitmapFromBuffer(col, row, img) since in the older version they used pil image format and now it\'s using numpy arrays so in the original code the used the pil function "imageData", instead of passing directly the numpy array as I\'m doing.\nAny help it\'s really appreciated.\n\nThis is my code conversion.\n\n'

S"\nI'm looking to draw outlines of 2D-closed irregular shapes with curved edges, and then compute both (a) the center of gravity (centroid) of the shape's area, and (b) the center of gravity of the shape's perimeter (i.e. the centroid of, e.g., a wire wrapped tightly around the outside of the shape). I have a late-beginner's level proficiency with Python and Matlab. \n(a) and (b) are easy enough given a polygon's vertices: the centroid of a polygon's area is given by the equation here, and the centroid of a polygon's perimeter is just the average of all the line segments' midpoints weighted by the line segments' lengths. I've already written some functions to do this.\nThe trouble I'm having is getting/approximating those vertices from any of the ways I know how to draw a closed shape with curved edges. The best solution I've come up with so far is to use something like this matplotlib-based script to draw the curvy shape, and then call path.to_polygons(), which converts Path objects to polygons \xe2\x80\x94 but does so with surprisingly low resolution, such that the resulting approximation is quite poor (and too poor for my purposes \xe2\x80\x94 I'd like to compute those centroids fairly precisely). \nSo, I'm looking to either (i) find some way to increase the resolution of .to_polygons (about 10-fold), which would be satisfactory for my purposes, or (ii) try some new strategy entirely. One option would be to draw the shapes using something like Adobe Illustrator and then get an approximation of their vertices via some plugin or maybe an image processing toolbox (but I have no clue how to do either of those things). Another would be to draw the shape using some toolbox/library that already has built-in functions for finding the centroids of areas and perimeters (I've seen some having the former, but none with the latter). But I'm sure there are many other options out there that I haven't considered.\n"

I modified your codes like below.\n\nExecPySf_1liner() calculates Legendre Symbol:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_symbol as below.\n\n\nI can understand your opinion. But you might slip over the fact that Python one-liners are functional programming and completed in one-liner. Because they don\'t use if then else syntax.  They must use lambda functions and don\'t use def functions.  Though they are not strictly referentially transparent, they are functional programming as elisp scripts are. And mathematical problem is easy to write in functional programming style like upper Legendre Symbol.\nIPython can save their notes as Matlab, Mathematica and you can re-use them. But the contents of the  notes are tangled as a whole. Ordinary people write a valuable expression after many suck expressions. And the valuable expression depends on some forward expressions in many cases. And It is bother to bring together the depended expressions. So the note was left tangled.\nAfter a year, when you want to re-use the valuable expression, you will forget details of the note and it will be difficult to re-use the valuable expression. Because you must remember the details as a whole.\nBut each Python one-liner is complete by itself. You can re-use them easily even after several years. You can easily merge Python one-liners, because they are functional programming.\nYou might be able to deal with Python one-liners more easily than Python expressions in IPython.\n\nI learned many things from modifying your elisp codes. I become a elisp lover. And I might become more familiar to elisp than Vim script. Thanks a lot.\n===============================================================================\n\nI extended Python slightly for mathematics. sfPP.py is a pre-processor and it changes a one-liner as following code. You don\'t need to write "print" because sfPP.py adds the print instruction.\n\n(This example codes also indicate why I dare to use temporal one-liner file. Smart Chris will understand the reason.)\nYou can easily watch Python source codes in Emacs as below.\n\n\nDo you agree with me to use Emacs as IPython ?\n\nLast question.\nI want to push accept button.

Therefore, I import r every time the function is called and also delete the rpy2 object. \nWithin the r function "call_function", I invoke some methods, which in turn creates reference class objects.\nWithin the R code, I use rm in the beginning of the code and also when the function some_function exits. \nGiven this background, the problem which I\'m facing now is that the rm does not remove any of the reference class in the code and I keep getting some warning like this\n\nHere, Rev_R5 is a reference class. I do not want this to happen, is there a way to remove all the methods, objects related to the reference classes using rm ? \n'

S'\nWhy would a call to processEvents block doing nothing for up to 9 seconds?\nI have an application with a PySide-based QT interface, where the UI code sits as a decoupled layer over the lower level actual application logic.  When the user performs an action which executes lower level application logic that may run for a while, effectively what happens is:\n\nDirectly on the GUI thread a progress dialog is displayed.\nDirectly on the GUI thread, the lower level logic starts a worker thread.\nDirectly on the GUI thread, the lower level logic loops updating the progress dialog (indirectly/decoupled) and ticking the application event queue via QtGui.qApp.processEvents() (again indirectly/decoupled).\nOn the worker thread, QT functions are invoked (again indirectly/decoupled) in reaction to events, and these happen on the GUI thread via slots/signals, running when the GUI thread (as mentioned above) calls processEvents().\nDirectly on the GUI thread, before the loop exits, the last processEvents() call blocks for around 9 seconds.  This is after all the logic on the worker thread is over and done with, and there are no more functions waiting to run on it via signal/slot calls.  Nothing related to my application is happening in this call.  What is it doing there?  Why is it blocking?  I\'ve tried passing in a max processing time of 300 ms and seeing if it exits, but this makes no difference.  The call locks up as long as it wants to.\nThe progress dialog closes and the user gets focus back.\n\nThis is all spread over a lot of files, implemented in a decoupled manner.  I\'ll try and provide snippets to give a picture of the flow.\nThe decoupled lower level logic worker loop:\n\nThe PySide/QT layer client event_tick function:\n\nSignal/slot usage in the PySide/QT layer to get worker thread calls happening on the GUI thread:\n\nThe reason that I delegate the calls on the worker thread over to the GUI thread using signals/slots, is that this is what PySide/QT requires given they will update the UI.\nReproduction case if you want to dig deeper:\n\nDownload and get the code running according to the GitHub project readme text.\nDownload the test file "NEURO" (<200KB in size) from mega (apologies, it was easiest site to upload to).\nLoad NEURO in PeaSauce.\nGo to offset 0x1A19E (CTRL-G)\nChange the data type to code (Menu: Edit / Change address datatype / Code)\nObserve progress dialog come and go.\nObserve ~9 second lock up.\n\n'

The naive way to do this is to fetch the parent, and then get the children using the list of child keys with $IN (in SQL, we would use a join). However, this means making 2 round trips for a fairly frequent operation. We have a few options to improve this, especially since we can retrieve the child keys at the same time as the parent keys:\n\nPut the children in the parent document\nWhile this would play to mongo's strength, we also want to keep this data normalized\nPipeline database requests in threads\nWhich may or may not improve performance once we factor in the connection pool. It also means dealing with threading in a python app, which isn't terrible, but isn't great.\nKeep the parent/child documents in the same collection (not embedded)\nThis way we can do one query for all the keys at once; this does mean some conceptual overhead in the wrapper for accessing the database, and forcing all indexes to be sparse, but otherwise seems straightforward.\n\nWe could profile all these options, but it does feel like someone out there should already have experience with this despite not finding anything online.

S'\nI would like to find a way to restrict a view (request handler) to only be called from within the Google App Engine internal network from within my view and not within app.yaml.\nFor example, I have a view to handle inbound email within my Flask application\n\nWhile I know I could put all my mail handlers in their own file / wsgi instance like so:\n\nI would prefer not to have to do this as I\'m using Flask instead of Webapp.  Right now the request works as setup above, but it is exposed to the world.\nInspecting the request to my inbound_notification_email() view, I see X-App-Country in the request header is set to ZZ and the request\'s remote address is 0.1.0.20.  I know the 0.x.x.x IP range is IANA reserved for local networks so it seems logical that checking if request.remote_address starts with "0." would work, but I\'m not sure if all internal requests within App Engine are always handled this way (push queues and xmpp come to mind).\nOne thing I was surprised to see was users.is_current_user_admin() returns False within inbound_notification_mail() even though you\'re to set login: admin when using Webapp.\n'

S'\nI want to write some random numbers into an ascii output file.\nI generate the numbers with numpy, so the numbers are stored in numpy.array\n\nAll three array are of the same size.\nI used standard file output, but this is really slow. Just about 8000 lines per 30 min. This may because I loop over three large arrays though.\n\nI also just used print str(random1[i])+"\\t"+ str(random2[i])+"\\t"+ str(random3[i]) and dumped everything in a file usind shell ./myprog.py > output.dat which seems a bit faster but still I am not satisfied with the output speed.\nAny recommendations are really welcome.\n'

S"\nI've been stuck for weeks trying to use ffmpeg to convert user uploaded videos to flv.  I use heroku to host my website, and store my static and media files on amazon S3 with s3boto.  The initial video file will upload fine, however when I retrieve the video and run a celery task (in the same view where the initial video file is uploaded), the new file won't store on S3. I've been trying to get this to work for over a month, with no luck, and really no good resources available for learning how to do this, so I figure maybe if I can get the ffmpeg task to run before storing the video I may be able to get it to work.  Unfortunately I'm still not a very advanced at python (or django), so I don't even know if/how this is possible. Anyone have any ideas? I am willing to use any solution at this point no matter how ugly, as long as it successfully takes video uploads and converts to flv using ffmpeg, with the resulting file being stored on S3.  It doesn't seem that my situation is very common, because no matter where I look, I cannot find a solution that explains what I should be trying to do. Therefore I will be very appreciative of any guidance.  Thanks. My relevant code follows:\n\nI can add any other info if needed to help me solve my problem.\n"

S'\nWhat is the easiest/fastest way to take a weighted sum of values in a numpy array?\nExample: Solving the heat equation with the Euler method\n\nD2u should be the second central difference in two dimensions. This would work if I could add indexes like (1,4)+(1,3)=(2,7). Unfortunately, python adds them as (1,4)+(1,3)=(1,4,1,3).\nNote that computing D2u is equivalent to taking a dot product with this kernel centered around the current position:\n\nCan this be vectorised as a dot product?\n'

S"\nI want to extract sentences of text, but I need exact position of results. Current implementation of tokenize.sent_tokenize in NLTK doesn't return position of extracted sentences so I tried something like this:\n\nBut it doesn't return exact position of sentences because sent_tokenize removes some writing characters (e.g. newline, extra spaces and ...) outside resulted sentence boundary. I don't want to use a simple regex pattern for splitting sentences and I know in that case this problem is trivial.\nThanks.\n"
