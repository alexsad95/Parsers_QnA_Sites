The youngsters (myself included graciously) also often tend to write everything small our of lazyness, but here it is switched, where gold is written with a capital g instead. This we do a lot in German, so it happens a lot to novices here, but it's funny seeing it from a native speaker. But all is topped by the same your/you're switch again, only the other way around this time. Yeee!

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:13:18] | questions:  Hi there.  I'm doing a little bit in the Blender Game Engine - as long as a hobby.  Studied Python, at the level of BGE. Here are some of my results: - example 1 - example 2 - example 3 - example 4 - example 5 - I closed the reference to the example of the game itself - I am remaking it in a new way.  And that's what I thought of. This topic I myself will not do (If the link does not work, let me know and I will fix it.) ... and I wanted to invite everyone who is interested in this - and even completely give the idea for the Python community (if it is interesting for many).  For beginning, I wanted to write a simple program menu, like in the Elementary OS, but not as a plug-in for the panel, but as a completely independent program, with the launch in the center of the screen, with the function of switching to the full screen. Prompt please with what to start correctly (I do not speak English - I'm Ukrainian, ), you can also join this topic - the license will be GPL - i.e., for all. Of course it's not good to speculate on brands, but the theme from the Blender Artists, is a good promotion for Python, as well as the way to self-fulfilling.  Thank you for your attention and patience.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:13:18] | questions:  I own a crappy 2005 chrysler town and country for $700. The thing has parts all over from the junk yard. The guy gave me 2 transponder keys. He said he lost his and had to buy more for 100 each key.Since buying this van 2 months ago, i just lost one of the transponder keys.  I started researching how to disable the magnetic coil for the alarm that needs the key chip. But i couldnt find a solid method that would work.  This was my method. I bought three $1 dollar keys at walmart, and ripped the chip out and taped it to the ignition coil. Looks dumb, but i dont care, i will never have to buy their dumb expensive key. I had to fight with the person at walmart to make the keys. She refused saying she cant make a non-transponder key for a transponder key.....until i stood there in front of her and cut out the transponder chip from the key and told her, here...now its a non-chip key. She's like your not going to use this for the ignition right? Im like no no no, this for the doors. You can even use these on the ignition    http://imgur.com/a/1Qnkp  Theres no reason i would spend 1/7th the cost for a key than the vehicle's value. Of course i would prolly do that to a $20,000 vehicle too i guess

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:13:18] | questions:  this thing i have created for Linux rocks! at least for me, it does. i use the command line quite heavily. even though i run my laptop in graphical mode under Ubuntu (16.04.3 LTS) Unity. i still have lots of terminal windows open (more than Firefox) and have made a lot of use of the screen command. i have even created an ssh script that lets me specify a screen session to connect to or create (ssh username+screenname@host+port).  the thing i have created is a set of Python scripts to front end the screen command in a few ways. the first is sbg which creates an idle (waiting for input) background session with my shell (bash) running. it includes 2 options (cols and rows) to set the virtual display size. the second is scn which connects to a background session just like the screen command does with the right options, but with less typing. the third is sin which lets me enter input (typed on the command line as arguments) to existing background sessions. the fourth is sls which lists the existing screen sessions. it is just a convenient way to do "screen -ls" the fifth is sss which takes a snapshot of the background session virtual display and outputs it. sss and sin are used the most. i use them most heavily on remote hosts and cloud instances because i don't keep so many ssh sessions open.  i can push heavier time consuming commands into background sessions so easily now that almost everything i expect to run longer than 20 seconds and don't need to immediately see the output from, i do through one of these background sessions with that sin command. it nicely inserts spaces between arguments and appends a carriage return at the end. an option exists to turn off the appended carriage return. it interprets sequences like \r and \t and inputs the corresponding single control character. it supports a larger set of these than the Python interpreter does for Python source code (so i am not using the interpreter to fudge any of this to be pythonic). it also supports carat sequences like ^c and ^[. ^i is a tab just like \t. ^m is a carriage return just like \r. it also interprets codes in octal like \033 and \o033 which are escape just like \e. and it interprets sequences in other bases: 10: \d255 16: \xff 4: \q3333 (think Quad) and 2: \y11111111 (think binarY). a better list of these is in the source code comments.  i've probably used these commands a couple hundred times, just tonight (past 3 AM now). i am still tweaking these and catching little bugs. i will likely release these, and separate functions to do the control character sequence conversion, sometime this month. other commands are planned to allow raw output to stdout, instead of to a background session. i am also looking around for how to make this into a codec, e.g. decode (\t to tab) and encode (tab to \t).

Or to start a search with the browser still closed by saying, "Hey Cortana, python numpy tutorial" (even if I'd get damned Bing search results). Or to say "Hey Cortana, what's the weather?" and have the AI show me today's weather forecast for my location, even speaking a summary of the weather to me. Or even that silly thing Microsoft encourages people to try: "Hey Cortana, tell me something interesting." The trivia that the AI came up with was good for slow moments.  It's not like I'm crying in my Scotch, or anything, but it now bugs me when I have to use the mouse or keyboard for some things.  Thanks for reading.

Oh, and it's 100% free.     It's great because you can just constantly take the "Mastery" tests and they will fill in your skills until you attain 100% mastery, and then you can move on to another topic. If you get stuck, you can get a hint or watch a video.  Anyway, just wanted to drop this off for any other programmers looking to brush up on their math.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:14:33] | questions:  My main question is for a LED LCD TV.   I usually keep all my electronics on 100% of the time. Computers, TVs, monitors, etc.  A couple of months ago, we turned off our TV and it wouldnt come back on (a 7 year old LED TV). WE quickly tried flipping the power button, and it came back on. So we just left it on. So a couple of weeks ago my wife accidentally turned it off and it never came back on. My first thought was a blown capacitor. So i checked the panels, and didnt see any damage to any of the capacitors. Then i deemed at that point the power supply must be the problem. So i ordered a whole new power supply board. Replaced it and nothing. Then we decided its not worth putting more money into than just putting it into a new TV. So we just bought a new TV.  Now i am wondering on how to avoid that same thing to this new TV.   We did leave the TV on 100% for all those 7 years. But i did set the contrast and brightness down to midrange beforehand. But if you turn the TV off the power supply is still getting power. In theory to truly remove power from the TV every night you would have to unplug it as the power supply still receiving power with it off.   I am just trying to get figure out how to extend the life of the TV to its max. I hate buying expensive items.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:14:33] | questions:  Obviously editing files is important, so why are editors such trash? Emacs is the theoretical best, due to it's incredible configurability, yet it's hindered(imo) by having an interface that's completely insane.  I end up using Visual Studio almost all day, and yet I hate how bloated and slow it is (does intellisense EVER finish loading documentation? ).  If I don't need VS's features, like source control, I'll use notepad++ for quick edits.  Sohere we are. Files need editing, and I dislike the tools available. What's a programmer to do?  Design the editor they wish they had all along, of course. A few ideas from emacs, the layout of visual studio, the speed of notepad++... hopefully :p  So the plan is to write an event driven text editing engine. Sort of like twisted. Until performance is an issue, I plan on implementing almost all features in user configurable files (including copy/paste). That way, you can change keybindings easily, while having working examples of how to extend the editor. Or, you know, wacky things like having different key bindings for different file types.  So, I have a few ideas on what I'd want this monstrosity to do. But what would your ideal editor look like/do? What ideas do you have for how the interface between text buffers and event handlers should look?

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:14:33] | questions:  I may be biased because I started with IDLE but want to get beyond that.   I am almost a 1 week Pythoner and managed to get through a 5 hour tutorial on Python. Having years of Assembly, Pascal, C, C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, BASIC and Visual BASIC among others, I was able to get going quickly, and have coded my first Python program destined to become my first app.  The instructor used IDLE. It was suggested that I check out Kivy and in that video, Pycharm was used. Although Pycharm has line numbers, I see little benefit to using it. I find IDLE easier to see if not only for its use colors. After that, I have not done much with either one.  It also appears that I cannot have both on my system. When I installed Pycharm, IDLE was no longer accessible until I uninstalled Pycharm.   Is there a benefit for me in app development for one over the other? Is there a way to have both that I nigh flip from one to the other? Might there be a down side to using one over the other?

rls version 0.9.0

syntax:
 rls [options] [names]

single letter options may be combined in a single command line token:
 -a append '/' to directory names
 -b show blocks allocated
 -d -D show date (-d for local, -D for UTC)
 -g -G show group name (-G for group number)
 -h -H show this help and quit
 -i show inode
 -l show long format
 -L show number of links
 -m show mode
 -n no recursion (maxdepth=0)
 -N append nanoseconds to time (if available)
 -p show where link points to
 -q output nothing
 -s show size
 -S show time/date as raw seconds
 -t -T show time and date (-t for local, -T for UTC)
 -u -U show user name (-U for number)
 -V show version number and quit
 +a select directories (ascending)
 +b select block devices
 +c select character devices
 +d select directories (descending)
 +h +H show this help and quit
 +f select regular files
 +l select symlinks
 +p select pipes
 +s select sockets
 +V show version number and quit

assignment options must be in separate command line tokens:
 cd=<directory> change to this directory (multiple)
 maxdepth=<num> maximum recursion depth

lt1/forums /home/forums 2> the options parser allows combining + and - options in the same command argument token, so, commands like rls +fl-lp are allowed (this selects regular files an symlinks, showing long format plus link reference).

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:15:40] | questions:  Has anyone tried the Coursera.org class on python machine learning?  They have an example in their "notebook", but their notebooks have a snippet approach. I can't find a complete code example and their code in the class assumes certain variables are there.  https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-ma...regression  What's totally unclear is how they load the X_train and y_train in their working example at about time index 8:55.  The code imports a crime dataset from an included text file and also uses a "load_crime_dataset()" method/function in a helper py file called "adspy_shared_utilities.py". That load_crime_dataset() method returns two values:  1. X_crime = crime.ix[:,range(0,88)] 2. y_crime = crime['ViolentCrimesPerPop']  But, since this helper code is not documented, it's unclear if these translate to X_Train and y_train per the courses's powerpoint slide.  Making the assumption that the code is correct, and running it, gives this error:  ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [499, 1495]  There doesn't seem to be any way for an "auditor" (that is, non-paying participant) of the course to get help. I've downloaded all the sample files, but no complete examples seem to exist with context.  Suggestions?  -- O

Then, I started thinking about my wireless keyboard.  When I turn it on, the battery LED turns green and then goes out after a second or two, thus indicating my batteries are OK.  But then, I recalled a project that I worked on which used a TI MSP430 processor. The current drain on the power source was only a few micro amps. So I theorize, that when the keyboard is first turned on, the filter capacitors would charge due to the initial surge, and would remain charged for quite a while, thus giving a false battery OK indication.   Bottom line, my new keyboard proverb: when in doubt, replace the batteries.  Come to think of it, I may still be on the original set of batteries, and I think I bought this keyboard about 5 years ago.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:15:40] | questions:  I've posted a question about abstract class and if I correctly constructed one and used it properly.  It made me remember all the funny procedures that Java devs have to go though for the simplest tasks.   For example, if I wanted to access the def charge(self): I just call cg.charge(), done!   In Java, it's another story.  I would need to down cast, which means using the instanceof keyword or getClass(), both of which is a big NO in Java. The other method is the visitor pattern. It's essentially just another class that takes the subclass and calls the method on that subclass. This has drawback of course, as you would have to know your sub classes a head of time or you would have to change the implementing class to accept that new type.  A lot of code for the simple task of accessing a subclass specific method.  Some days I just wake up, breathe in the fresh air, and think, damn it's good to work with Python.    I'v got another example, but I'll share it later.   Any stories of specific tasks made easier with Python than another language?

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:15:40] | questions:  a feature i'd like to add, or have added, or see added, to ssh is an exchange (added protocol layer) between a program run at the remote host and the client making the connection, offers an API to incrementally access a file, or multiple files, at the remote host, along with an action request sent by the remote host. a special program on the remote host would be given a list of files on the remote host to edit. it would then send special controls to trigger an editor in the client. the local edit run by the client would request file data to be read for it and pass file data to be written. in the end the user can do local speed interactive editing of a file on the remote shell. other file activities could be done this way as well. the change to ssh could be minimal. added code would watch for the trigger and run a child program on the local host to do the rest an just shuffle data between the remote host and the child until the child exits. after it exits, go back to normal operation. everything else would be implemented in these external programs which could be implemented in Python.

I have a background working with Java, and at first I wasn't in any rush to learn Python. I tried it a while ago, but became frustrated, gave up and uninstalled it. Fast forward a few years later, I picked up a text book, finished, and couldn't help but think, Why did I give up the first time?!??! I just experimented with namedtuples this morning, and given that I write a lot of classes that are just data containers, and favor immutable objects, named tuples provided the convenience I needed! I even learned how to sort it.   C# now has tuples, does any one know if they took the concept from Python? It seems a little different from the Python implementation.

C took 2nd seat and Pike got bumped to 3rd. since then i also had a look at Lua and Go but they just could not overwhelm Python in my mind. the biggest killer of Go for me was the use of ":=". if Python had used it, i would not be here.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:16:50] | questions:  While working on a task today, my brain was occupied by another task that I'm not quite sure how to solve. Either I'm trying to do too many things with a design that doesn't allow it or I'm not thinking about it properly. This isn't an professional issue or problem with code I'm having, so please don't move this thread to General Coding Help, it's more a recreational problem. Here it is:  Suppose you've been tasked with creating a system to allow students to register for a course, and view there grades at the end of the course. This same system should allow the professor to generate an attendance list of his/her class.   The problem I'm having is where would the student grade go? or the student relationship to class.  My thinking is:  A Student can enroll in a class, provided it isn't full.   A Class can have a list of students.   A Student can obtain a grade in the course they enrolled in.   class Student:

    def __init__(self, id, firstname, lastname, listofcourses):
   
        self._id = id
        self._firstname = firstname
        self._lastname = lastname
        self._listofcourses = listofcourses;class Course:

    def __init__(self, courseID, courseName, professor listofStudents):
 
        self._courseID = courseID
        self._courseName = courseName
        self._professor = professor # A class called professor
        self._listofStudents = listofStudents
        self._isFull = False  Should the Student class have a list of Courses that he/she has enrolled in?  Should Course have a list of students who have enrolled in the class?  Where would Student grade go for each class?  Using this design, how would a professor generate an attendance sheet?  Am I trying to accomplish too many things with a design that doesn't allow it?   A little Googling turned up this link and this one. Because of the many-to-many relationship, you would create a junction table, but how then would a professor generate an attendance list with the database? Would grade go in the junction table?

Currently work as an Operations Manager in the construction industry.  I have been making and selling websites since I was a 13 year old, and my passion has always been everything to do with computers. I left college after getting a A-Level in computer science, as well as English and History, and have found myself unfortunately drift away over the years from doing what I enjoy!  I have a plan to, over the next three years, work on becoming a Python developer and start doing a job I love and enjoy. I first discovered Python earlier this year, and have enjoyed the learning process. It's been a struggle being so out of practice, but I have hugely enjoyed using my brain again, so to speak!    As much experience as I can gain over these three years is obviously a bonus.  Two questions really.. 1) Is freelancing in my spare time a viable option? How is it best to get started in this? 2) Are there any industry recognized qualifications that would actually be worth getting? I have seen the "nanodegree" in full stack development, but is this something actually worth doing or does experience generally speak louder than qualifications?  Many thanks in advance, James.

I usually go in an order of attempting to answer questions VS going down the line of "unread posts". When you come in from just a single day and there are 100+ threads with unread posts. But i noticed the other day i tend to follow a pattern.   I first glance for spam and remove it if any  I then read and answer (or just comment on) any forum issues, account activation issues, troublemakers, etc.  Then i look for library questions i probably know the answer to (for me i would look for pygame/BeautifulSoup how to's) Orwhatever library i am using at the time  Then if there is someone online at the time i am, i tend to look at their question first as it yields quick responses.  Then i look for simple questions such as errors resulting from typos, or a missing parenthesis  Then i look at every other unread post  Then if i feel real chatty, i glance at the first page of unanswered posts.  And i base almost all of that on the title of the post. *Sometimes using the hover tooltip to get more info.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:16:50] | questions:  I had an easy time with HTML and Visual Basic.   As of now though, I'm starting to have my doubts. I'm struggling to learn Python. And I've been playing light bot (a puzzle game made to simulate what its like to be a programmer), and doing terribly. I had to look up the solution to puzzle 10. And in light bot 2, I haven't solved one of the recursion puzzles. I've had to look up the answer for all of them, and I can't imagine how a human could even come up with such solutions. They all look futile to me. The last one I tried I resorted to just tossing in random commands hoping I would guess the right answer.  I only have an average IQ, so I'm hardly a genius. I'm really thinking that this isn't something an average human could possibly do.  And I don't get why people keep saying the word 'logic' when referring to programs. There's nothing 'logical' about it to me. You're just sitting there trying to describe to a calculator how to set up some dominoes to get the result you want. That's not logic. You're trying to give instructions to something that's dumber than an animal. The cursed thing won't even remember what you had it do unless you explicitly tell it to do so. It has NO common sense. And its so mindless it'll walk off a cliff unless you tell it to stop. Freaking ants have more brains than this thing does.  I'm thinking I may need to stick to mark-up languages. I really don't see myself being able write scripts. The sole reason I'm even trying to learn python anyway is so a I can make games (I'm assuming you need to learn python first before you can even begin to use pygame).

Recently, I discovered os.scandir written by Ben Hoyt  see: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/ and: http://benhoyt.com/writings/scandir/  i have not done much with it yet, but interactively ran it and iterated over the results, simply writing each item out to disk, and then editing the file with Notebook++  I passed as a path the root directory of a 5TB drive, which had .5 TB populated I didn't think anything had happened when I ran it the first time, because it only ran for a few seconds. Then when I opened the results file, I was amazed to find 299,681 entries containing all files and their full path.  There's more, I haven't found out how to access it yet, but also gets the os.stat and 'other' information as well. the claim is that it's 20 times faster than os.walk.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:16:50] | questions:  Im mainly asking here because i know a user did some hiring for a company. Although it might of just been the portion of verifying code, not sure.   Isnt it illegal for employers to ask such a question?   They sneak this in through a survey that you *must* submit with your application. But it is not considered "apart" of your application. Even though you cannot submit your application without submitting the survey. And there is no "i dont want to answer" option, there is only yes or no.   Ive heard that employers get a tax credit for hiring the "poor" or long-termed unemployed, and this is their method to bypass the privacy laws. However i also heard that the label "poor" is just as bad as "metally ill" or "convicted felon" as being labeled "lazy". And employers would only want to hire just enough lazy people to get the tax credit, and no more after.   Im assuming whether you get or have received assistance is private and cannot be attained by the employers anyways. So in the event you do get assistance and lie on the application, they could never verify that you lied to fire you afterwords? lol  Does anyone know of any accuracy on this?

From the little bit of research I've done, it looks like iOS is pretty trash at running non-objective-c programs (though that could be outdated info) (and maybe you still can't transfer files to them, and need to email yourself or use cloud storage since Apple refuses to use usb for some reason).  The Microsoft Surface is an option, though I'd rather avoid paying so much for what is essentially a laptop with a touchscreen.  A secondary desire is the ability to cross compile Rust apps for the tablet, but I think that can work regardless of the tablet's os.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:18:06] | questions:  Being a proud alumnus of the National Radio Institute (circa 1973), a Correspondence School* with a very long history, I thought I'd search online and see if it was still around and if so, what it was up to. During that search, I came across a .pdf file of one of their later projects, it seems around 1979, for students to build. Sadly, I was unaware of this class until, well, yesterday. It would have been a blast to build. Unfortunately, this doesn't contain the actual schematic, but it does give an in depth description of operation. I don't want to spoil the surprise by telling you exactly what it is, but I'm sure you old timers and maybe even you new timers will chuckle, as I did at where we were 40+ years ago.  Here you go: Remember When   * For you young folks out there, before the internet, if you were unable to attend or afford a brick and mortar college, you had "Correspondence Schools" which allowed you to continue your education. This involved the school mailing you your lesson, with a test and you in turn mailing back your answers to the exam. If you passed, they would mail the next lesson and test.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:18:06] | questions:  Hi,  I have been playing with the new wxpython phoenix and like very much what I am finding. I am especially interested in the Advanced User Interface module that is a pure python rewrite by Andrea Gavana and can be found in wx.lib.agw.aui.  There's some pretty powerful stuff here, dock-able windows and toolbars, resizable partitioned windows (or frames) and lots more. What's missing are documentation on a lot of the new features, even though in general the documentation is pretty good.  Examples are few and far between (there's a few good ones in the demo app) just as an example, here's  a screenshot of the AUI docking window manager:     click to enlarge  I am hoping there will be some interest here, to try and get some sample code put together. I'm doing my best, and will create tutorials when I'm ready to do so. I'm currently working on the multi column window, and have created a generic basic manager window (code below).  I am excited about what I am finding, I think it would be great if this could replace tkinter as a pre-packeged GUI.  So if you're looking to play with something new, I'd love some company creating example code. For noobs, I have a tutorial on installation here https://python-forum.io/Thread-How-to-in...om-scratch  Here's the basic manager window as it stands now:

        size=(400, 400),
        style=wx.DEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE,
        screen_factor=.5):
   self.screen_factor = screen_factor
   self.get_screen_info()

   wx.Frame.__init__(

   )

   self._mgr.SetManagedWindow(self)

   self._perspectives = []

   self._mgr.Update()

   self.Bind(wx.EVT_CLOSE, self.on_close)

 def get_screen_info(self):
   self.screen_width = GetSystemMetrics(0)
   self.screen_height = GetSystemMetrics(1)
   self.scwidth = int(self.screen_width * self.screen_factor)
   self.scheight = int(self.screen_height * self.screen_factor)
   self.hoffset = int((self.screen_width * .2) / 2)
   self.voffset = int((self.screen_height * .2) / 2)

I was once working with a customer who was producing on-board software for a missile. In my analysis of the code, I pointed out that they had a number of problems with storage leaks. Imagine my surprise when the customers chief software engineer said "Of course it leaks". He went on to point out that they had calculated the amount of memory the application would leak in the total possible flight time for the missile and then doubled that number. They added this much additional memory to the hardware to "support" the leaks. Since the missile will explode when it hits it's target or at the end of it's flight, the ultimate in garbage collection is performed without programmer intervention.  If the leak will take longer to eat all the memory than the hardware will exist... is it really a problem?

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:19:28] | questions:  when i make a loop, i often need for the body of the loop to do something different or a little bit different in the first pass or the last pass. sometimes i need for the body of the loop to do something different in both, and in most of those cases the first and last passes are different from each other. i wish the evolution of programming languages had included this in its syntactical design. short of iterating on input from a dynamic source (pipe, socket, generator) it's not really hard to do this. iterating on a list, for example, is still done with some kind of indexing or queuing that can do this. even queuing can make it possible for most dynamic sources.  i'm recoding my pipeline stuff today.  it involves a need where the first and last commands in the pipeline need special handling, but i'd like to have all the like handling be done by the same lines of code.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with Neri Oxman, she is an Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT.  She runs the Mediated Matter research group at MIT and is doing things that any doomsday-est should ne forced to study. This is AI taken to the nines. One of the most interesting projects has been the silk pavilion environment. It is a delicate marriage between nature and technology that has built a remarkable Architectural structure made by robotics and silk worms. Rather than try to explain it, here's a video that will blow your mind. So bring out the coke and Twinkies and take a look at this: http://matter.media.mit.edu/environments...-pavillion  And a Ted talk on this and other projects she is involved with: https://www.ted.com/talks/neri_oxman_des...nd_biology  When done, if you still have some Twinkies, check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZNTzkAR1Ho  enjoy

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:20:57] | questions:  It's been a while since I listed to satellite radio. Over the past three months (yeah, I'm very near the end of my free trial lol), I've started noticing something odd and magical. It's probably just probability smiling down on me combined with observer bias, but it seems like a lot of the time, when I change stations, the new station is at the very beginning of *something* (either a song, or an announcer's message just after a song). Which got me thinking...  If this is real (and it's probably not), I was wondering how it'd be possible. Well, the satellite knows who individuals are, since you have to connect using your device id to verify that you have access to the stream. Which means there's a handshake that takes place, where the device (probably a car) says "hi, I'm xxxx, and I want to stream yyyyy", followed by "hello xxxx, you have the ok to stream yyyyy, connect to frequency zzzzz to begin streaming".  But what if the stream isn't "radio" at all, but pre-recorded streams? If the dj marks certain points of the stream with waypoints, then there could be quite a few different streams for a single station. So if the dj puts a waypoint at the beginning of the current track, then the service could start a new stream every 10 seconds or so that starts at that point. Each station would have maybe 20ish different streams, each delayed a little more than the last, all delayed a few seconds from "live". Any new connections get routed to whichever stream is nearest a waypoint and newest, giving almost everyone a "wow, look at you, this song JUST started!!!" feel, while still blasting a single stream to thousands of people instead of an individual stream to each connection.  I don't know if that makes any sense, and I'm pretty sure that's not what they do, but I think it's a cool idea.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 13:20:57] | questions:  how should one post without code?  is it valid to ask a question without including any code?  what if i want to just understand the general meaning of an error message?  when i run into an error in a program i often get an error message. the other major error result is incorrect output. another is that the program does nothing. if i did get an error message the (approximately) first thing i do is try to understand what the error message means. most of the time it is a syntax error. my most common mistake is forgetting a trailing ) from the previous line. so i usually need to get the line number from the traceback and look there or the line above.  but in rare cases i don't understand the error message. why can't i just ask about that without the code?  it is common for us to want to see minimal code. but these would be questions along the lines of why does my code failat that? seeing the code helps.  minimizing the code helps. it also helps debugging. i have a funny story about that from days long ago which i may post later.  but i want to at least try to understand each step along the way.  dealing with, or getting the most information from, the error message is one of the first.  i don't like long code. if someone posts a question asking why their code failed, and code is long, i usually just skip over it.  if i were a moderator, i might have to do something, but i am not. this is why minimized code is better. since it is usually a good debugging process, it should be done, anyway. that gets us into the mindset "post the (minimal) code"  i just want to understand if we always need to post code here. maybe that "post the (minimal) code" mindset has blurred us into thinking we need to see the code more often.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 14:44:44] | questions:  Hi there.  I'm doing a little bit in the Blender Game Engine - as long as a hobby.  Studied Python, at the level of BGE. Here are some of my results: - example 1 - example 2 - example 3 - example 4 - example 5 - I closed the reference to the example of the game itself - I am remaking it in a new way.  And that's what I thought of. This topic I myself will not do (If the link does not work, let me know and I will fix it.) ... and I wanted to invite everyone who is interested in this - and even completely give the idea for the Python community (if it is interesting for many).  For beginning, I wanted to write a simple program menu, like in the Elementary OS, but not as a plug-in for the panel, but as a completely independent program, with the launch in the center of the screen, with the function of switching to the full screen. Prompt please with what to start correctly (I do not speak English - I'm Ukrainian, ), you can also join this topic - the license will be GPL - i.e., for all. Of course it's not good to speculate on brands, but the theme from the Blender Artists, is a good promotion for Python, as well as the way to self-fulfilling.  Thank you for your attention and patience.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 14:44:44] | questions:  I own a crappy 2005 chrysler town and country for $700. The thing has parts all over from the junk yard. The guy gave me 2 transponder keys. He said he lost his and had to buy more for 100 each key.Since buying this van 2 months ago, i just lost one of the transponder keys.  I started researching how to disable the magnetic coil for the alarm that needs the key chip. But i couldnt find a solid method that would work.  This was my method. I bought three $1 dollar keys at walmart, and ripped the chip out and taped it to the ignition coil. Looks dumb, but i dont care, i will never have to buy their dumb expensive key. I had to fight with the person at walmart to make the keys. She refused saying she cant make a non-transponder key for a transponder key.....until i stood there in front of her and cut out the transponder chip from the key and told her, here...now its a non-chip key. She's like your not going to use this for the ignition right? Im like no no no, this for the doors. You can even use these on the ignition    http://imgur.com/a/1Qnkp  Theres no reason i would spend 1/7th the cost for a key than the vehicle's value. Of course i would prolly do that to a $20,000 vehicle too i guess

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 14:44:44] | questions:  this thing i have created for Linux rocks! at least for me, it does. i use the command line quite heavily. even though i run my laptop in graphical mode under Ubuntu (16.04.3 LTS) Unity. i still have lots of terminal windows open (more than Firefox) and have made a lot of use of the screen command. i have even created an ssh script that lets me specify a screen session to connect to or create (ssh username+screenname@host+port).  the thing i have created is a set of Python scripts to front end the screen command in a few ways. the first is sbg which creates an idle (waiting for input) background session with my shell (bash) running. it includes 2 options (cols and rows) to set the virtual display size. the second is scn which connects to a background session just like the screen command does with the right options, but with less typing. the third is sin which lets me enter input (typed on the command line as arguments) to existing background sessions. the fourth is sls which lists the existing screen sessions. it is just a convenient way to do "screen -ls" the fifth is sss which takes a snapshot of the background session virtual display and outputs it. sss and sin are used the most. i use them most heavily on remote hosts and cloud instances because i don't keep so many ssh sessions open.  i can push heavier time consuming commands into background sessions so easily now that almost everything i expect to run longer than 20 seconds and don't need to immediately see the output from, i do through one of these background sessions with that sin command. it nicely inserts spaces between arguments and appends a carriage return at the end. an option exists to turn off the appended carriage return. it interprets sequences like \r and \t and inputs the corresponding single control character. it supports a larger set of these than the Python interpreter does for Python source code (so i am not using the interpreter to fudge any of this to be pythonic). it also supports carat sequences like ^c and ^[. ^i is a tab just like \t. ^m is a carriage return just like \r. it also interprets codes in octal like \033 and \o033 which are escape just like \e. and it interprets sequences in other bases: 10: \d255 16: \xff 4: \q3333 (think Quad) and 2: \y11111111 (think binarY). a better list of these is in the source code comments.  i've probably used these commands a couple hundred times, just tonight (past 3 AM now). i am still tweaking these and catching little bugs. i will likely release these, and separate functions to do the control character sequence conversion, sometime this month. other commands are planned to allow raw output to stdout, instead of to a background session. i am also looking around for how to make this into a codec, e.g. decode (\t to tab) and encode (tab to \t).

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 14:45:47] | questions:  My main question is for a LED LCD TV.   I usually keep all my electronics on 100% of the time. Computers, TVs, monitors, etc.  A couple of months ago, we turned off our TV and it wouldnt come back on (a 7 year old LED TV). WE quickly tried flipping the power button, and it came back on. So we just left it on. So a couple of weeks ago my wife accidentally turned it off and it never came back on. My first thought was a blown capacitor. So i checked the panels, and didnt see any damage to any of the capacitors. Then i deemed at that point the power supply must be the problem. So i ordered a whole new power supply board. Replaced it and nothing. Then we decided its not worth putting more money into than just putting it into a new TV. So we just bought a new TV.  Now i am wondering on how to avoid that same thing to this new TV.   We did leave the TV on 100% for all those 7 years. But i did set the contrast and brightness down to midrange beforehand. But if you turn the TV off the power supply is still getting power. In theory to truly remove power from the TV every night you would have to unplug it as the power supply still receiving power with it off.   I am just trying to get figure out how to extend the life of the TV to its max. I hate buying expensive items.

INFO    \ [02/19/2018 14:45:47] | questions:  Obviously editing files is important, so why are editors such trash? Emacs is the theoretical best, due to it's incredible configurability, yet it's hindered(imo) by having an interface that's completely insane.  I end up using Visual Studio almost all day, and yet I hate how bloated and slow it is (does intellisense EVER finish loading documentation? ).  If I don't need VS's features, like source control, I'll use notepad++ for quick edits.  Sohere we are. Files need editing, and I dislike the tools available. What's a programmer to do?  Design the editor they wish they had all along, of course. A few ideas from emacs, the layout of visual studio, the speed of notepad++... hopefully :p  So the plan is to write an event driven text editing engine. Sort of like twisted. Until performance is an issue, I plan on implementing almost all features in user configurable files (including copy/paste). That way, you can change keybindings easily, while having working examples of how to extend the editor. Or, you know, wacky things like having different key bindings for different file types.  So, I have a few ideas on what I'd want this monstrosity to do. But what would your ideal editor look like/do? What ideas do you have for how the interface between text buffers and event handlers should look?

Having years of Assembly, Pascal, C, C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, BASIC and Visual BASIC among others, I was able to get going quickly, and have coded my first Python program destined to become my first app.  The instructor used IDLE. It was suggested that I check out Kivy and in that video, Pycharm was used. Although Pycharm has line numbers, I see little benefit to using it. I find IDLE easier to see if not only for its use colors. After that, I have not done much with either one.  It also appears that I cannot have both on my system. When I installed Pycharm, IDLE was no longer accessible until I uninstalled Pycharm.   Is there a benefit for me in app development for one over the other? Is there a way to have both that I nigh flip from one to the other? Might there be a down side to using one over the other?

rls version 0.9.0

syntax:
 rls [options] [names]

single letter options may be combined in a single command line token:
 -a append '/' to directory names
 -b show blocks allocated
 -d -D show date (-d for local, -D for UTC)
 -g -G show group name (-G for group number)
 -h -H show this help and quit
 -i show inode
 -l show long format
 -L show number of links
 -m show mode
 -n no recursion (maxdepth=0)
 -N append nanoseconds to time (if available)
 -p show where link points to
 -q output nothing
 -s show size
 -S show time/date as raw seconds
 -t -T show time and date (-t for local, -T for UTC)
 -u -U show user name (-U for number)
 -V show version number and quit
 +a select directories (ascending)
 +b select block devices
 +c select character devices
 +d select directories (descending)
 +h +H show this help and quit
 +f select regular files
 +l select symlinks
 +p select pipes
 +s select sockets
 +V show version number and quit

assignment options must be in separate command line tokens:
 cd=<directory> change to this directory (multiple)
 maxdepth=<num> maximum recursion depth

lt1/forums /home/forums 2> the options parser allows combining + and - options in the same command argument token, so, commands like rls +fl-lp are allowed (this selects regular files an symlinks, showing long format plus link reference).
